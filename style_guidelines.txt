Overall look and feel of SportsMate
-----------------------------------

The overall look and feel of SportsMate will be simplistic and easy to navigate, but will include bright colours to reflect the excitement of playing sports.


Colours
----------
We want to use a vibrant colour theme to emulate the excitement associated with sports.
The following are our colour swatches:

- #1CC283
- #14DE40
- #2EB29E
- #63C2BE
- #9FE3E2

Iconogrophy
----------
Icons will be simple and minimalistic. They will be white to match the simplicity of the website.

Typogrophy
----------
We will be using Montserrat from Google Fonts.

Links
----------
Links will not be underlined by default, but they will be blue. They will become underlined when hovered over.

Buttons
----------
The buttons will not have borders. The main signup button will be rounded but the other buttons will be squares.
We will make the signup button stand out to the user to draw their attention towards it.
